d3 first-steps
==============

Those are my first steps on d3, I'm following the tutorials of [d3Vienno on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6il2r9i3BqH9PmbOf5wA5E1wOG3FT22p).

I'm also adding some work for an oncomming project based on d3 and angular.

Note : There is a Gruntfile.js, only to launch a local http server with `grunt serve` in development. You may not need it.
