d3-first-steps
==============

Those were my first steps on d3, following the tutorials of [d3Vienno on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6il2r9i3BqH9PmbOf5wA5E1wOG3FT22p).

This was a work research for my project [topheman-datavisual](https://github.com/topheman/topheman-datavisual) (realtime datavisualization with Angular, d3, and nodejs based on Twitter Stream API).

For d3 new commers (and myself when I'll be looking for snippets), there are some good resources - the examples are testable online at [topheman.github.io/d3-first-steps](https://topheman.github.io/d3-first-steps) and the source code is available here in that repo.

**TL;DR** : A bunch of d3 examples and resources.

If you clone the repo (not necessary to access examples and code) :

* `npm install`
* `grunt serve` will launch the site on `http://localhost:9000`
